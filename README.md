# Proposal
The main project is the development of a LiDAR sensor, along with a mapping graph.
The graph itself was developed with Next.js, using the react-chartjs-2 library.
For more information about the system, please take a look at our article:

# Why to use Next.js ?
Next builds a fully optimized node.js server that helps the client side to be optimized. Thus, we are able to create a back-end application that runs alongside our front-end, with simple steps.

The back-end server is responsible for connect the front-end side and the LiDAR sensor, so each part can get info (is this case mapped data) from another.

Beyond that, next.js uses a recent version of webpack and many other features, so that everything, including the front-end side, is efficient and fast.

# What if i don't know how to use next.js ?
Well, if you would like a preview video od what was developed, plese check

To start out in Next.js it's pretty dawm simple... I will link some webpages below and the next.js docs...
